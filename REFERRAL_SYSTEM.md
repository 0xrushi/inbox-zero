## Implementation Plan

### Overview
The referral system will allow existing users to invite friends via unique referral codes or links. When a referred user signs up and completes their 7-day trial, the referrer receives a month of free service.

### Technical Components

1. **Database Schema** ✅
   - Referrals table to track referral relationships
   - Referral codes table for unique code generation
   - Referral rewards table to track awarded benefits

2. **Backend Logic** ✅
   - Referral code generation and validation ✅
   - Trial completion tracking ✅
   - Automatic reward application ✅
   - API endpoints for referral management ✅
   - Server actions for mutations ✅

3. **Frontend Components** ✅
   - Referral dashboard showing code and stats ✅
   - Share buttons for easy sharing ✅
   - Referral status tracking ✅
   - Copy-to-clipboard functionality ✅
   - SWR integration for data fetching ✅

4. **Email Integration**
   - Invitation emails to referred friends
   - Notification when referral completes trial
   - Reminder emails for pending referrals

### User Flow
1. User accesses referral page
2. Gets unique referral code/link
3. Shares with friends
4. Friend signs up using referral code
5. Friend completes 7-day trial
6. Original user receives 1 month free

## Implementation Notes

### Code Patterns Followed

1. **API Routes**: Using `withAuth` middleware and proper response type inference
2. **Data Fetching**: Using SWR hooks for client-side data fetching
3. **Mutations**: Using server actions with `next-safe-action`
4. **Types**: Using Prisma-generated types instead of manual interfaces
5. **Error Handling**: Using `SafeError` for user-facing errors

### TypeScript Configuration Issues
There are TypeScript module resolution issues that need to be addressed at the project level. The following imports are showing errors:
- `crypto` module imports
- `date-fns` imports
- `react` and component imports
- `next/server` imports

These appear to be configuration issues rather than code issues.

### Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Database Migration**: Run Prisma migration to create the new referral tables
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name add-referral-system
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is set correctly

3. **Navigation**: Add a link to the referrals page in the main navigation

4. **Signup Integration**: 
   - Add referral code input field to the signup form
   - Call `applyReferralCodeAction` after successful signup
   - Call trial tracking functions when appropriate

5. **Trial Completion Tracking**:
   - Integrate `markTrialStarted` when user begins trial
   - Integrate `completeReferralAndGrantReward` when 7-day trial is completed
   - Set up a cron job to run `checkAndExpireStaleTrials` daily

6. **Testing**: 
   - Test referral code generation
   - Test applying referral codes during signup
   - Test reward granting after trial completion

### Security Considerations

- Referral codes are case-insensitive to improve user experience
- Users cannot refer themselves
- Each user can only be referred once
- Referral codes can be deactivated if needed
- Consider implementing rate limiting on referral code creation
